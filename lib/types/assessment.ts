/**
 * The assessment shapes the client is allowed to know about.
 *
 * Types only — this module compiles away, so importing it ships nothing. The
 * question bank itself lives in `api/_lib/question-bank.ts` and never reaches
 * the client bundle: it carries every `correctAnswer`, and a learner who can
 * read the answers can pass any assessment without learning anything.
 *
 * A question therefore arrives from `/api/assessments/start` with its answer
 * and explanation removed. Both come back after grading, in the submit
 * response, which is when the learner is meant to see them.
