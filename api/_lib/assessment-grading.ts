 * route could promote their own proficiency, and `user_skills.current_score`
 * is read by `api/_lib/tutor-prompt.ts` for every AI turn — so a forged score
 * did not merely unlock content, it changed how Shamwari teaches.

 * The server now grades from the submitted answers against an answer key it
 * resolves itself. The client may still grade locally for immediate feedback;
 * only what this module computes is ever persisted.
