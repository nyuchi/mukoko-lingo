## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **The server issues the assessment, not just the score** — grading moved
  server-side in v0.2.0, but the answer key was still built from the question
  ids the *caller* submitted (`answerKeyFromBank(bank, Object.keys(answers))`).
  Submitting a single correct answer therefore scored 1/1 = 100% and wrote
  `user_skills.current_score = 100`, which `api/_lib/tutor-prompt.ts` reads on
  every AI turn: the caller could not choose the numerator, but choosing the
  denominator did just as well. Found by running the real grading module
  against the real question bank, which the mocked route tests could not show —
  they supplied the key that the live code derives from the request.

  `POST /api/assessments/start` now selects the questions and records their ids
  in `lingo.assessment_sessions`; `POST /api/assessments/submit` requires that
  `session_id` and grades against the issued set. An unanswered question is
  wrong, an id that was never issued is not graded, and a session is single use
  (claimed with a conditional update, so two concurrent submissions cannot both
  grade it), expiring after two hours, and readable only by its owner — another
  learner's id returns 404 rather than 403.
- **The answer key no longer ships to the client** —
  `lib/data/assessment-questions.ts` carried every `correctAnswer` into the app
  bundle, so a learner could read the answers out of the JavaScript. It now
  lives at `api/_lib/question-bank.ts`, and questions cross to the client
  through `toPublicQuestion`, which drops the answer and the explanation. Both
  come back in the submit response, after the attempt is closed.
  `question-bank-isolation.test.ts` walks `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`,
  `constants/` and `web/` and fails if anything imports it back — a re-added
  import would break no type check and no other test.

### Changed
- **The assessment screen no longer grades locally.** It asks the server for a
  quiz, submits answers, and shows the server's verdict. Two consequences worth
  knowing: there is no per-question "Correct!" during the quiz (the screen does
  not know — the full review with answers and explanations arrives with the
  result), and assessments now need connectivity, so the screen offers a retry
  instead of silently showing an empty quiz.
- `user_assessments` rows carry the `session_id` they were graded under.
- `scripts/create-indexes.ts` adds an `assessment_sessions` TTL index, so
  lapsed quizzes are swept rather than accumulating.


_Nothing yet._

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-08

### Security
- **Assessments are graded on the server** — `POST /api/assessments/submit`
  recorded whatever `score` and `passed` the caller sent, and promoted
  `user_skills.current_level` on that basis, so anyone who could reach the
  route could promote themselves. Because `user_skills.current_score` is read
  by `api/_lib/tutor-prompt.ts` for every AI turn, a forged score did not only
  unlock content — it changed how Shamwari taught that learner. The route now
  computes the score from the submitted answers against an answer key it
  resolves itself (the `lingo.assessments` document when one exists, otherwise
  the shared question bank), and **rejects** a body carrying `score` or
  `passed` rather than ignoring it. A level is only promoted by a real
  assessment document naming a `target_level`, so a pass on a client-assembled
  quiz records a score and nothing more. The client now submits answers; it
  still grades locally for immediate feedback, but only the server's number is
  persisted.
- **Log messages are data, not format strings** (`api/_lib/logger.ts`) — every
  route builds its message with a template literal over request data, and Node
  reads `console.error`'s first argument as a `util.format` template. A `%s` in
  a submitted field could swallow the next argument and rewrite the line, and a
  newline could forge an entire extra entry. The prefix and message are now
  passed as arguments to a constant `'%s %s'`, and control characters are
  replaced. Flagged by CodeQL on the grading PR, whose new log lines carry a
  caller-supplied `skill_id` and `assessment_id`.
- **`user_skills` rows are written against the `skills._id`** — the question
  bank labels skills by name, and a name in that column produces a row the
  tutor prompt and the skills API both silently ignore. The route resolves
  either form before writing.

### Fixed
- **Assessment routes resolve a UUID `_id`** (`api/_lib/doc-id.ts`) — all three
  looked assessments up by `ObjectId` only. `lingo.assessments` is empty and
  unseeded while every populated `lingo` collection uses UUID strings, so a
  UUID-seeded assessment would have 404'd from `GET /assessments/:id`, gone
  unjoined in the history, and — worst — skipped the promotion branch in submit
  without any error.

### Changed
- **The release job pushes its version bump with `RELEASE_BUMP_TOKEN`** — the
  org-wide PAT that can push through branch protection, with a per-repo
  `RELEASE_TOKEN` as an override. v0.1.0 and v0.1.1 were both tagged on their
  merge commits because the bump was rejected; the workflow simply was not
  asking for a token that already existed. The fallback (tag the merge commit,
  publish the Release anyway) is unchanged, and its warning now names the
  likely cause instead of telling the reader to create a new PAT.

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **release**: count the next version from the tag when it is ahead of the files (#40) (`b8cb526`)

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-01

### Security
- **AI system prompt moved server-side** — `/api/ai/chat` now builds the tutor prompt in `api/_lib/tutor-prompt.ts` from the authenticated user's proficiency and ignores any caller-supplied `system_prompt`. The only request fields that influence the prompt are `language` and `conversation_type`, both mapped through allowlists in `lib/ai/prompt-builder.ts`, so an unrecognised value becomes a known constant instead of reaching the template.
- **Chat input is validated as a security boundary** (`api/_lib/chat-input.ts`) — a client-supplied `system` role is rejected outright (a provider would read it as instructions), along with unknown roles and non-string content. History is capped and forced to open on a user turn.
- **Moderation enforced on the server, across the whole history** — guardrails moved to `api/_lib/moderation.ts` and now scan *every* turn rather than only the newest. Previously moderation lived solely in the client bundle, so posting straight to the route bypassed it, and a payload placed in an earlier turn or a forged `assistant` turn reached the model unchecked. Blocked requests return 400 with the guardrail reason, which the client now surfaces instead of a generic connection error.
- **`moderation_alerts` are actually written** — the admin review queue and analytics read the collection, but nothing had ever written to it, so the queue could never show an item.
- **Logout revokes the WorkOS session again** — `verifyAccessToken` accepts a `allowExpired` option so sign-out can revoke the session behind an already-expired access token. Signature and all other claims are still verified; only the expiry window widens.
- **Six UUID/ObjectId query fixes** — leftovers from the Supabase→MongoDB migration. One would have made every moderation alert permanently unresolvable.

### Fixed
- **Web sign-in dead end** — AuthKit issued the authorization code then tried to hand it to `mukokolingo://`, which no browser can open. `lib/auth/workos-client.ts` is now platform-aware and navigates the full page on web.
- **Adaptive tutoring restored** — moving the prompt server-side made it read `lingo.user_skills`, which is empty and written by nothing (scores live in device storage), so Shamwari scaffolded every learner as an absolute beginner. The client now sends a numeric proficiency map that the server clamps; stored scores win whenever they exist.
- **Redirect allowlist matched what clients actually compute** from `window.location.origin` — private-LAN Expo dev hosts and the bare `mukoko-lingo.vercel.app` alias were rejected before WorkOS ever saw them.
- **`max_tokens` had a ceiling but no floor** — a negative or fractional value reached the provider and came back as a 502. Now clamped to an integer in [1, 4096].

### Added
- **Releases are automatic** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — a merge to
  `main` whose CI run goes green is tagged and published without anyone
  touching a version number. The next version is derived from Conventional
  Commit subjects since the last tag (`feat:` minor, `fix:`/`perf:`/`refactor:`
  patch, housekeeping releases nothing, and a breaking change stays inside 0.x
  until 1.0 is cut deliberately). The job bumps all nine files that carry the
  version, moves `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` section under the new heading,
  tags, and publishes a GitHub Release whose notes are that section. Preview
  any merge's outcome with `npm run release:dry`. Full details in
  [RELEASES.md](RELEASES.md).
- **Documentation drift check** (`scripts/docs/check-docs.js`, CI job `docs`) —
  fails the build when shipped code reads an environment variable
  `.env.example` does not document, when a retired name (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, the invented `mukoko-lingo` database) reappears in the
  docs, when a relative markdown link points at nothing, or when CLAUDE.md's
  test-suite count no longer matches the suites on disk. It found an
  undocumented `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` and four dead documentation links on
  its first run.
- **`docs-maintainer` agent** (`.claude/agents/docs-maintainer.md`) — owns
  keeping the written record true, with the checklist of documents that go
  stale together (change an env var, and five files need visiting).
- **BRANDING.md** — the Five African Minerals palette, voice, typography and
  touch-target rules, derived from `constants/Colors.ts`. Three documents had
  been linking to it for months; it had never existed.
- **Single-provider AI transport with a circuit breaker** (`api/_lib/ai-provider.ts`) — Cloudflare Workers AI reached through Cloudflare AI Gateway, on the OpenAI-compatible `/ai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. 3 failures open the breaker for 5 minutes, so an outage fails fast instead of making every learner wait out the 15s timeout. `AiNotConfiguredError` and `AiUnavailableError` stay distinct so moderation cannot silently pass all content when it breaks.

### Changed
- **AI provider: Anthropic + Vercel AI Gateway → Cloudflare Workers AI** — inference is now `@cf/qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-fp8` on Workers AI, routed through Cloudflare AI Gateway. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` are gone, replaced by `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (required) and `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_ID` / `CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_TOKEN` / `WORKERS_AI_MODEL` (optional). The Anthropic Messages transport, the dual-credential split and the per-language Kimi routing were all removed — `language` and `conversation_type` now shape only the system prompt. Conversation documents record `modelProvider: 'cloudflare'`, and the unused `ai` / `@ai-sdk/openai` packages were dropped from `package.json`.
- **Database: Supabase PostgreSQL → MongoDB** — Reverted the data layer back to MongoDB (the platform's original database before the 0.0.1 Supabase migration). All API routes now read/write MongoDB collections via `lib/db/mongo.ts` / `lib/db/collections.ts` instead of `@supabase/supabase-js`. Phrases collapse from a normalized `phrase`+`translation` join into one flat document per phrase (matching the pre-Supabase shape already used by `lib/data/phrases-data.ts`); `ai_conversations` now embed their messages; hand-rolled "select-then-insert" upserts (phrase progress, user skills, SRS cards, assignment submissions) became atomic `findOneAndUpdate`/`bulkWrite` upserts. Fixed two latent bugs surfaced during the port: the auth lookup now keys profiles on the stable WorkOS `workos_user_id` instead of email, and the leaderboard query's `user_id`/`person_id` field-name inconsistency was standardized on `user_id`.
- **Auth: Stytch → WorkOS AuthKit** — Replaced Stytch (email OTP, WhatsApp OTP, magic links) with WorkOS AuthKit's hosted sign-in page via the PKCE authorization-code flow. `api/_lib/auth-middleware.ts` now verifies access tokens locally against WorkOS's JWKS instead of round-tripping to the auth provider on every request. WhatsApp OTP has no WorkOS equivalent and was dropped.
- **Documentation rewritten against the code, not from memory** —
  `RELEASES.md` now describes the automated flow instead of a manual
  branch-tag-publish ritual (and no longer names a `mukoko-lingo` database);
  `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md` was measuring 8 suites and a Supabase client
  that no longer exists, and now reports the real 42 suites, the thin
  functions-threshold margin, and the fact that `api/**` — every security
  boundary in the app — has no coverage floor at all;
  `docs/EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md` was configuring Supabase email with a palette that
  is not the brand's, and now targets the WorkOS AuthKit dashboard;
  `.env.local.example` was pure Supabase/OpenAI/Next.js from before the
  migration. `CONTRIBUTING.md` gained the commit-type → release-effect table,
  since a commit subject now decides the version.
- **Dependencies** — Updated all packages across `root` and `web/`: Expo SDK 54 → 57, Next.js 15 → 16, Tailwind CSS 3 → 4. Held back `jest`/`@types/jest` (jest-expo still requires Jest 29) and `@testing-library/react-native` (v14 switches to async `render()`/`renderHook()`, which would require rewriting every test file).
